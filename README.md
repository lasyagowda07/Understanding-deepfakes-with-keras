# Understanding-Deepfakes-with-Keras
Implement Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network, and you will train the network to generate realistic looking synthesized images. The term Deepfake is typically associated with synthetic data generated by Neural Networks which is similar to real-world, observed data - often with synthesized images, videos or audio and ultimately generate synthetic images similar to hand-written digit 0 from the MNIST dataset.
